# siamese_implement
this is the implementation of the Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition research paper in Keras(tensorflow backend).

For the ease of understanding I've collected everything in one python file. This is the implementation of Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition research paper ,which originally uses the omniglot dataset for training (https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot).
The data can be downloaded from the link above.
For some insight into the code and better understanding please follow this article:

I've also put up an example image for some reference.
